# ASP.Net-CSharp-JQuery_PracticeWebApp
A practice web application that mimics an Online Banking Site.

####Overview
This is a project I am working on to expand and better develop my ASP.net/C# skills. Most of the web pages are templates. I created a small
 database to store user information into 3 tables: Users, Accounts, Transactions. It's very similar to my Java Bank Acc Management program. So 
 far a user can log in and view their information. Cookies are created and used to handle any data retrieved from the database. This project is 
 definitely in its early stages! 
 
####WIP
 * Allow new users to register for an account.
 * Allow existing users to update their password and/or retrieve their password.
 * Add content to the About, Contact, and Feedback pages.
  - About: General description of the purpose of the website
  - Contact: Display contact information
  - Feedback: Allow users to post comments (This will most likely use JQuery)
* Format elements to make the site look "prettier" and more appealing to the eye!
